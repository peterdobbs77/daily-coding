# Risk Management Frameworks

Always ask:
* How will this system be used (not just in isolation)?
* What other risks may be related or intertwined (cybersecurity, privacy, patient hazards, etc)?

While researching these RMFs, I think back to the [Deon Ethical Checklist for Data Scientists](https://deon.drivendata.org/), which I have used in the past.

Key acronyms:
* Test, Evaluate, Verify, and Validate (TEVV)

## [NIST AI RMF](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-1)

All AI actors (e.g., designers, developers, integrators, deployers, etc) share responsibilities for the trustworthiness of an AI system.

Characteristics of trustworthy AI systems include...
1. Valid and reliable
2. Safe
3. Secure and resilient
4. Accountable and transparent
5. Explainable and interpretable (see [NIST AI Research - Explanability](https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/ai-research-explainability))
6. Privacy enhanced (see [NIST Privacy Framework](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.CSWP.01162020))
7. Fair with harmful biases managed (see [Towards a Standard for Identifying and Managing Bias in Artificial Intelligence](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1270))
