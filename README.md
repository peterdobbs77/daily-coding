# daily-coding
In order to keep my coding skills sharp and practice new ways of developing code, I intend to work on a new project nearly every day. I hope to find problems that range in complexity and platform so that I can grow my skills.

I'm currently using Visual Studio Code and programming in Python 3.7.4 32-bit.
