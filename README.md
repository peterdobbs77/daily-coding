# daily-coding

In order to keep my coding skills sharp and practice new ways of developing code, I intend to work on a new challenge nearly every day. I hope to find problems that range in complexity and platform so that I can grow my skills.

I'm starting with using Visual Studio Code and programming in Python 3. Some of my contributions to this repository will involve other languages, such as C/C++, as it applies to particular interview prep.
