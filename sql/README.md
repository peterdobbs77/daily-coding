# SQL Examples

Here you'll find example sql projects I've used to learn and improve my skills

[try_ski_hill_db_sql.ipynb](try_ski_hill_db_sql.ipynb) builds on my work in [try_product_db_sql.ipynb](try_product_db_sql.ipynb) and takes inspiration from a problem I was asked in an interview about designing a ski resort from existing infrastructure, defined in a sql database.

[try_product_db_sql.ipynb](try_product_db_sql.ipynb) is a formalized version of some of the problems posed in [sample_sql.sql](sample_sql.sql).

[sample_sql.sql](sample_sql.sql) has my solutions to simple questions, laid out in a sql file.
