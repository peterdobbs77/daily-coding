# sum_check_k

I'm sure there's a better way to describe this kind of problem than "sum check k" but that's what I'm going with. *So get over it already*

## Prompt
Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of `17`, return true since `10 + 7` is `17`.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## Implementation
According to my stop-watch, I finished in **27:06.40**. A lot of that time was spent setting up my debug environment, since VSCode was acting up, and correcting syntax because I get mixed up between *R*, *Matlab*, and *Python*. *__sigh__ such is the life of a grad student*
